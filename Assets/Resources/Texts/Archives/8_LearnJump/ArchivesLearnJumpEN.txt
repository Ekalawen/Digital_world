[Morgensoul*]: I must say that I am impressed.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Uhh, I'm not sure I understand.
[Morgensoul*]: Well, it's been a long time since nobody had passed the recruitment phase so quickly.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Wait, you've already told me that ... I thought it was settled a long time ago and that I was already one of yours!
[Morgensoul*]: You know, a simulation within a simulation within a simulation. Classical day.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: But then, the fake-CRINM, the Probes, the Datation, the attack on the Servers by the CRINM ... all of that was fake? Made from scratch?
[Morgensoul*]: And yes. What do you want, we never take enough precautions.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: So ... am I one of yours now?
[Morgensoul*]: Yes. And with that you are entitled to your share of complications. You will see that just the fact that you communicate with us will increase the attention that the CRINM will bring to you.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: I am so happy! And yes, I was prepared for it.
[Morgensoul*]: But that also allows us to entrust you with some of our programs!
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Your programs?
[Morgensoul*]: It's a software we've been developing for a few months now. We know there is an enormous potential, but our hardware is not yet powerful enough to fully support it.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: And what does it do?
[Morgensoul*]: We call it Dash015 by its little name! It will allow you to perform your hacks even faster!
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Cool! And you give it to me like that?
[Morgensoul*]: Give it? It doesn't cost us anything, it's just a copy. Still, we are going to need you in an External Matrix. It's the kind full of Jumps(). Do you know what they are?
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: That doesn't mean anything to me.
[Morgensoul*]: They are defense programs that work by periodic voltage modulations. It blows your brains out if you keep in touch with the Matrix. Stay away from the walls when you hear it approaching.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: They detect me on contact? Very well, I would be airy in that case!
[Morgensoul*]: Motivated? Perfect, because it's one of CRINM's most used programs. So let's go !
