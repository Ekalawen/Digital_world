You succeeded! Congratulations!
To go to the next level you need to find the correct password.

From now on, and for all subsequent levels, each password will consist of two parts.
The Pass and the Trace.
You will need to be in possession of both to restore the password.

The Pass is the result of an enigma. This enigma is given to you when you pass the level for the first time. The enigma may seem difficult at first. But each treshold will give you clues to help you solve this enigma.
The Pass never contains spaces or capital letters. It can contain special characters.

The Trace consists of 4 characters.
First 2 binary characters (0 or 1).
Then 2 hexadecimal characters (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, or F).
It is given to you when you pass the level for the first time.

The password is the juxtaposition without space of the Trace then of the Pass.
For example: if Trace = <b><color=#DARK_CYAN>10B4</color></b> and Passe = <b><color=#ELECTRIC_BLUE>matrix</color> </b> then the password will be <b><color=#DARK_CYAN>10B4</color></b><b><color=#ELECTRIC_BLUE>matrix</color></b>.

Tip: It is possible to hack Passes online because they are fixed. However, the Trace is unique and specific to your version of the game. So most of the time you will have to complete the level at least once to unlock the Trace.
