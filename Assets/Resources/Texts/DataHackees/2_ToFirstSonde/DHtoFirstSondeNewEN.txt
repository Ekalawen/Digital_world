You succeeded! Congratulations!
To go to the next level you need to find the correct password.

When you collect Data in the previous level, you will increase your Data Count.
The Data Count will allow you to unlock new tresholds in the Hacked Data() (here) which will give you more clues.
The Data Count accumulates the Data of each of your games, even if you lose, and therefore only increases!

<color=#CYAN><b>Redo the previous level</b></color> to increase your Data Count and reach the next treshold!
