You succeeded! Congratulations!

The Pass is the result of an enigma given to you when you pass the level for the first time.
The Pass enigma may seem difficult at first, but each treshold will give you clues to help you solve this enigma.

The Pass never contains spaces or capital letters. It can contain special characters. But it cannot contain accents.

Try to increase your Data Count to get the Pass of this level!

Pass: I am the title of the second level of this game. 

<b><color=#CYAN>Tip</color></b> : If your Pass is incorrect but close enough to the correct Pass, you will be shown the number of additions, deletions, and character replacements to make in your Pass to arrive to the correct Pass.
