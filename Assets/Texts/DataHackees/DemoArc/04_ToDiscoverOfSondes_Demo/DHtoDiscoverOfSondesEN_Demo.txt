You succeeded! Congratulations!

The Pass is the result of an enigma given to you when you pass the level for the first time.
The Pass enigma may seem difficult at first, but each treshold will give you clues to help you solve this enigma.

The Pass never contains spaces or capital letters. It can contain special characters. If it should contain an accent, replace it with the letter without the accent. 

Try to increase your best number of Blocks crossed to get the Pass of this level!

Pass: I am the title of the second level of this game. 

<b><color=#CYAN>Tip</color></b> : If your Pass is incorrect but close enough to the correct Pass, you will be shown the number of additions, deletions, and character replacements to make in your Pass to arrive to the correct Pass.
