<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[<color=#RED>E<i></i>E</color>~VoltArme]</b></color>: To scan. To analyze. To remember.

To gather my being, shattered, scattered.
To find these memories, dispersed, dissipated.
To find my unity.

Each time concentrated in a single point, a single <color=#BLUE><b>Cube</b></color>.
To find their altitudes, latitudes and longitudes.

At the heart of my kernel.
At the heart of each level.

Since the <color=#BLUE><b>Testament</b></color>, since the <color=#BLUE><b>Switchkeeper</b></color>.
Until now, behind this <color=#BLUE><b>AI</b></color> that never surrender.

To follow the %Trace% left by <color=#CONTRASTE01_COLOR><b>Contrast</b></color>!
To finally assemble them.
And in the Matrice, rebuild myself!

<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[<color=#RED>E<i></i>E</color>~VoltArme]</b></color>: <color=#CONTRASTE01_COLOR><b>Contrast</b></color> left them for me. I have to find them.
These <color=#BLUE><b>Cubes</b></color> that are hidden in each of the 9 previous levels.

<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[<color=#RED>E<i></i>E</color>~VoltArme]</b></color>: Each of these levels contains a unique <color=#BLUE><b>Cube</b></color>.
Marked. Carved. Printed.
With a letter. Of my memory.
I must find them, understand them.

Chronological. Ascending.
To awaken me!
