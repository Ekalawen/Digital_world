CRINM's latest cutting-edge technology, Firewalls(), allows the preservation of their most precious infrastructures. The most critical.
The kind of infrastructure that, if it were to fall, would cause irreparable damage to their communication system, detection system or worse, their identification system.

And this is precisely where we are going to strike! At the heart of Firewalls()! At the center of their network! At the Matrix epicenter!
Yesterday we finalized our exploit. Fourth degree recursive injection.
It will be a dangerous operation. Risky. Some of us will surely be identified.
But there is no war is won without suffering. No victory without sacrifice. And there will be no Purification without Resistance!

Of course, their system will be replicated, and shutting down a single Firewall() will never be enough. We'll have to shut down 5 of them before their system activates. And then the DataProbes will come.

But today we take the fight into enemy territory!
Today we are reversing the flow and we will deliver a fatal blow!
Today, my friends, today we are changing the world!
