<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[E-metalover]:</b></color> Contrast! ... Contrast? Shit, he's completely inert, Wolfvÿre was really not kidding... He was lucky that nobody found him before me... Well, let's see what I can do to restore the link...

<color=#RED>*** Re-establishing the body-shell link. ***</color>

<color=#CONTRASTE01_COLOR><b>[Contrast01]</b></color>: Haaaaaaa! Thank you Ema! You saved my life! What a hell! Really, I swear! You can't imagine what it's like to have your mind going around and around, thinking, thinking and thinking... All the time! Without seeing, hearing, feeling anything, day or night...  Ahhhh the fresh air ... it's beautiful !
<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[E-metalover]</b></color>: Haha I'm glad to see that you have nothing and to find you in this shape!
<color=#CONTRASTE01_COLOR><b>[Contrast01]</b></color>: I really don't know how to thank you ... Oh yes I do! Do you remember that <color=#GREEN><b>Ultimate Pas<b></b>sword</b></color> from the <color=#BLUE><b>last Treshold of the level The Awakening</b></color>? Well, it's not limited to 3 uses, you can use it as many times as you want to unlock any level!
<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[E-metalover]</b></color>: This is a very useful hack! Thanks a lot! However I think I will only use it as my last chance. I prefer to unlock levels by myself, with my own skills, it's more rewarding, more satisfying, more fun!
