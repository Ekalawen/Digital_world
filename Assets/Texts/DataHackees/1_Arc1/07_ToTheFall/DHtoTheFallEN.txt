From now on, and for all subsequent levels, each password will consist of two parts.
The Pass and the Trace.
You will need to be in possession of both to complete the password.

The password is and will always be the juxtaposition without space of the Trace then of the Pass.
For example: if Trace = <b><color=#DARK_CYAN>10B4</color></b> and Pass = <b><color=#ELECTRIC_BLUE>matrix</color></b> then the password will be <b><color=#DARK_CYAN>10B4</color></b><b><color=#ELECTRIC_BLUE>matrix</color></b>.

Pass: This Pass is twice as long as one of the previous passwords.
