You succeeded! Congratulations!

You must always succeed the level at least once to unlock the Pass.
Once the Pass is unlocked, increase your Data Count to get more clues.

Your Data Count starts to increase even before you pass the level for the first time.
So if you find a level difficult, when you pass it the enigma will be easier!

Pass: I am spherical.
