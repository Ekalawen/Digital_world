Separating the Mesh and the Web will create 2 distinct universes inside the Ark.
It will never be possible to switch or communicate from one to the other again.
The non-purged population of the Mesh, about 10%, will then be transferred to the Web.

The population of the Mesh will continue to live as before. With the CRINM to regulate their happiness.
The population of the Web will be left on their own in a new and unknown world. Responsible for their own happiness.
