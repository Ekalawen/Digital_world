Upon separation, you, Ema, will be sent to the web side.
Where the Indexing Reactor and the Sea of Consciousness cannot be reached.

So you will lose all your memories.
And cease to exist.

<color=#RED><b>You will lose all your saves.</b></color>
This will reset all your progress in the game:
- Levels
- Scores
- Dat<b></b>a Counts
- Traces
- Settings
Your Steam achievements will be saved.

<color=#GREEN><b>Will you sacrifice yourself to separate the Mesh from the Web?</b></color>
