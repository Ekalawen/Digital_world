2143. Due to uncontrolled global warming, the Earth has become uninhabitable. To survive, the human race has gathered the remnants of humanity into the Ark, a fully automated vessel designed to roam indefinitely in space.

Inside the Ark, the survivors are constantly connected to a virtual simulation of reality in which they continue to communicate and live.
Today, humanity lives inside a computer simulation, inside the Mesh.

In this world entirely free of need, the real issues of humanity emerge: information, knowledge, control, identity, freedom.

It is in this context that a tentacular multinational, the CRINM (Numerical and Media Identity Referencing Company), has appropriated the market of human registration. The identifiers of individuals, previously secured by the States, are now secured by the CRINM, which does not hesitate to use this formidable tool to make profits out of any control...

A revolutionary group, the H@ckers (Anonymous Heirs of Kantian, Ethical and Revolutionary Culture) have made the CRINM their main target and are recruiting the Netrunners' elite to fight against it. Hackers, hacktivist geeks, guardians of freedom, nemeses of injustice... and now you, Ema Etlover.
