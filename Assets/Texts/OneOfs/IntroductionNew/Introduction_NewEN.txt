<color=#BLUE><b>2143</b></color>. Due to uncontrolled global warming, the <color=#DARK_CYAN><b>Earth has become uninhabitable</b></color>. To survive, the human race has gathered the remnants of humanity into the <color=#BLUE><b>Ark</b></color>, a fully automated vessel designed to <color=#DARK_CYAN><b>roam indefinitely into space</b></color>.

Inside the <color=#BLUE><b>Ark</b></color>, the survivors are constantly connected to a virtual simulation of reality in which they continue to communicate and live.
Today, <color=#DARK_CYAN><b>humanity lives inside a computer simulation</b></color>, inside the <color=#BLUE><b>Mesh</b></color>.

In this world entirely free of need, <color=#DARK_CYAN><b>the real issues of humanity emerge</b></color>: information, knowledge, control, identity, freedom.

It is in this context that a tentacular multinational, the <color=#BLUE><b>CRINM</b></color> (Numerical and Media Identity Referencing Company), <color=#DARK_CYAN><b>has appropriated the market of human registration</b></color>. The identifiers of individuals, previously secured by the States, are now secured by the <color=#BLUE><b>CRINM</b></color>, which does not hesitate to use this formidable tool to make profits out of any control...

A revolutionary group, the <color=#BLUE><b>H@ckers</b></color> (Anonymous Heirs of Kantian, Ethical and Revolutionary Culture) have made the <color=#BLUE><b>CRINM</b></color> their main target and <color=#DARK_CYAN><b>are recruiting the <color=#BLUE><b>Netrunners</b></color>' elite to fight against it</b></color>. Hackers, hacktivist geeks, guardians of freedom, nemeses of injustice... and now you, <color=#BLUE><b>Ema Etlover</b></color>.
