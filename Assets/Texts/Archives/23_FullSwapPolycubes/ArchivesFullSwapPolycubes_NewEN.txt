[V1P3R]:I knew someone would be watching you. You see Ema, precautions always pay off in the end.
[E-metalover]: Well this time, I'll grant you that you were right... V1P3R, meet DarkLurk. He doesn't call himself like this, but he's a memory shaper. He will help us. Reluctantly, no doubt about that, but he will help us.
[V1P3R]: I don't trust him... Did you check him out?
[E-metalover]: Check him?
[V1P3R]: Yes, I'll show you.
[DarkLurk]: Wait, ladies! Wait a second! Let me show you this first!

*** Broadcasting of a memory of the user DarkLurk. ***

[V1P3R]: Haha funny! I like this little guy actually Ema!
[E-metalover]: You like him just because before he met us he set up a program that he has to deactivate every hour or else it'll alert the CRINM and letting them known his last location?
[V1P3R]: Yes! And by showing us his memory as he did, we have proof that this program really exists!
[E-metalover]: Yes, but let me remind you that he can forge memories. He could have created that memory just now to protect himself.
[V1P3R]: But do you and I know the difference between a fake and an original? No. And having a mind as twisted as his, I'd be tempted to bet that this is indeed one of his memories.
[DarkLurk]: Glad to finally run into some rational people who understand the situation! Nice to meet you!
[V1P3R]: Well, you know, an hour is more than enough time to shut down your program. I've located its location.
[DarkLurk]: The memory might be true, but I could have altered the scene so you couldn't locate it. Also, you don't know exactly when the program is supposed to update. You could have much less than an hour. But I digress, how can I help you?
[E-metalover]: ... Don't you want to check him anyway V1P3R?
[V1P3R]: Yes, clearly. Nothing against you DarkLurk, just stand still.
[DarkLurk]: If you don't mind me saying, you're trying to analyze a memory juggler, I'm not sure you can get anything out of that analysis.
[V1P3R]: We'll see about that!

*** Remote query of the Indexing Reactor from the DarkLurk ID. ***
*** Injecting the result into the Sea of Consciousness. ***
*** Repatriation of the spectrum of the consciousness of the selected individual. ***
*** Behavioral analysis of the current user... ***
*** Acrobatic unicorn. Alternative chocolate. Omniscient penguin. ***
*** Failed behavioral analysis. ***

[V1P3R]: ... There are only improbable randomly generated memories... There is nothing to be gained from this analysis, except to wonder how he doesn't go crazy with such memories...
[DarkLurk]: I told you so! But since I am a gentleman, and I find you entertaining, I offered you my help anyway. I'd be sorry if you turned me down now!
[E-metalover]: ... Alright... We want to join the Mesh.
[DarkLurk]: Oh, as far as I know, the last Commµtator heading for the Mesh is possessed by the CRINM. You'd better get used to the vast expanse of the Web now...
[E-metalover]: I imagine the passage must be guarded. Probes? Tracers?
[DarkLurk]: Nothing so primitive. It's guarded by the Switchkeeper. Reputedly unbreakable.
[E-metalover]: Perfect then. I'm a little rusty from the last few Commµtators.
[DarkLurk]: Don't tell me you're going to go head-on?
[E-metalover]: Of course we are.
[DarkLurk]: This is crazy! No one has ever seen the Switchkeeper in phase 3!
[V1P3R]: Do you think like me Ema?
[E-metalover]: Of course I do. We'll go that way.
