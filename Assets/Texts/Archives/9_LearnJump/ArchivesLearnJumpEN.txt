[Morgensoul*]: I must say that I am impressed.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Uhh, I'm not sure I understand.
[Morgensoul*]: Well, it's been a long time since nobody had passed the recruitment phase so quickly.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Wait, you've already done it to me ... I thought it was settled a long time ago and that I was already one of yours!
[Morgensoul*]: You know, a simulation within a simulation within a simulation. Like everyday life.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: But then, the fake-CRINM, the Probes, the Datation, the Servers attack by the CRINM ... was all that fake? Made from scratch?
[Morgensoul*]: And yes. What do you want, we never take enough precautions.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: So ... am I one of yours now?
[Morgensoul*]: Yes. And with that goes your share of complications. You will see that just the fact that you communicate with us will increase the attention that the CRINM will have on you.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: I'm so happy! And yes, I was prepared for it.
[Morgensoul*]: And you can keep Dash15 as a result. Still, we are going to need you in an External Matrix. It's the kind full of Jumps(). Do you know Jumps()?
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: That doesn't mean anything to me.
[Morgensoul*]: These are defense programs that work by periodic voltage modulations. It blows your brains out if you keep in touch with the Matrix. Stay away from the walls when you hear it approaching.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: They detect me on contact? Very well, I would be aerial in that case!
[Morgensoul*]: Motivated? Perfect, because it's one of CRINM's most used programs. So let's go!
