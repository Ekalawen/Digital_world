[Morgensoul*]: The thing is that it was just one Probe. Well, it's rarely just one Probe. It's often ...
[Ema Etlover]: A multitude. Yeah, I know. But what difference does it make? It's a primitive, predictable defense program.
[Morgensoul*]: Maybe. Still, these are just prototypes. The CRINM ones are much more advanced...
[Ema Etlover]: Whether they come from us or them, a few well-placed WallJumps() to get around them and the issue is settled!
[Morgensoul*]: Don't be too hasty. You're not a part of this us yet.
[Ema Etlover]: Friendly.
[Morgensoul*]: And don't forget that we'll have to erase the history of our meeting... and your associated memory. If you fail.
[Ema Etlover]: What? You will not touch my memory!
[Morgensoul*]: As if you could stop us...
[Ema Etlover]: Look, I'm here to find out why I'm the only one who remembers of the Mental Blackout. All human beings have lost their memories of that moment, they can only remember a black, empty screen. But I remember very well where I was, what I was doing, every detail... So if you touch my memory... if you touch the very reason why I am here ... then the CRINM will become the least of your worries.
[Morgensoul*]: We would just erase your memories related to the H@ckers. It's not a big deal.
[Ema Etlover]: This memory is the very definition of who I am! It's absolutely essential! I have to understand!
