[Morgensoul*]: We both know that a Netrunner is not worth much without its programs.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: I couldn't agree more! I've heard that the more experienced of us can use up to 4 multithreading!
[Morgensoul*]: Yes, but we are not there yet. If you join the H@ckers, you will have to know how to use the program that we have developed.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Oh that's interesting!
[Morgensoul*]: It's a software that we have been developing for a few months now. We know there is enormous potential, but our hardware is not yet powerful enough to fully support it.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: And what does it do exactly?
[Morgensoul*]: We call it Dash15 by its little name! It will allow you to perform your hacks even faster!
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: Cool! And you give it to me like that?
[Morgensoul*]: Give it? It doesn't cost us anything, it's just a copy.
[Cilliannelle Crittefigiée]: It's the power of IT, duplicating knowledge costs nothing!
[Morgensoul*]: Well no, it costs time, memory and attention. But isn't that one of the reasons for living? Anyway, don't forget that this is an intensive test, we put all the power of our hardware to feed this simulation. Outside Dash15 is much less efficient ...
