[DarkLurk]: Oh well, here's one! Honestly, you couldn't have made more noise when you arrived.
[E-metalover]: Excuse me, do I know you?
[DarkLurk]: Apparently not, since we weren't even in the same world. But now that it's changed, welcome!
[E-metalover]: Uh, thanks... Wait, did you say more noise? Did you hear me arrive?
[DarkLurk]: Well, it's not every day that so many new people reach the Parallel Web.
[E-metalover]: But how could you spot me in the first place? Even using my Pathfinder() in all directions I couldn't find the shadow of a living being!
[DarkLurk]: It's just that your algorithm is not optimized for the new conditions of the environment you are using it in. The world here is much larger vertically, so you need to use a hierarchical OctTree to store the nodes of your Pathfinder(). And it allows you to find things other than Data thanks to a different path. Don't take it personally, but it's a pretty basic optimization. 
[E-metalover]: I must admit that I didn't expect to get algorithmic lessons from a stranger when I came here ... Actually, I'm looking for people ... maybe you could help me?
[DarkLurk]: People, you mean your companions? Oh yes, of course I know where they are. But here, even more than up there, as you can imagine, everything has a price. Especially for you, since you don't seem to have many other options.
[E-metalover]: ... How much do you want?
[DarkLurk]: How much? Oh no no no! We don't use anything as volatile, conceptual and theoretical as a currency here! No, what I want are your memories!
[E-metalover]: My memories?? There is no way!
[DarkLurk]: Hey hey! It's ok, I'm not going to steal them, I just want to see them, observe them. That's all!
[E-metalover]: ... I'm sorry, but I don't really see the point of this for you... And if I can't see the point, then I'm clearly not going to like it.
[DarkLurk]: Your reasoning makes sense. I like you! I'm an envelope provider.
[E-metalover]: A what?
[DarkLurk]: An envelope provider! Really? Have you even heard of the CRINM?
[E-metalover]: If you don't get your sense of respect back quickly, I promise you the only thing you'll get back is your sense of regret.
[DarkLurk]: Oh no I'm so scared haha! Well at least you weren't completely afk where you came from. So you know that the CRINM controls what people can think, they reduce the intensity of their impulses and emotions, their will to rebel, their individuality.
[E-metalover]: Yes, you mean the Purges().
[DarkLurk]: ... No. The Purges() are a disaster, we agree. But even before that! Even before you get purged, up there, you're <i>all</i> still influenced by the total control of the CRINM. Slightly. You may not fully realize it... It's about 1.5% where after a Purge() it's more like 98.5%.
[E-metalover]: Everybody?
[DarkLurk]: All those referenced in the Indexing Reactor anyway.
[E-metalover]: Ah!
[DarkLurk]: And that's why envelope providers like me exist! We can't consider withdrawing from the Indexing Reactor, because it's far too complex an operation for the average person, and it would also force us to live as outcasts. Because at the slightest contact with the CRINM, they would realize that we are not referenced, and they would immediately reference us again.
[E-metalover]: So what you're offering is... ?
[DarkLurk]: Well, my incredible envelopes that you absolutely need are bodies, referenced, but with the constant CRINM manipulation erased! You may have noticed that you felt lighter when you arrived here, in the Web? That's because the grasp that the CRINM had on you is not working here. You could also say that I am a freedom merchant, that's fine too. But to create these envelopes, I need memories to inject into them, that's my raw material if you will.
[E-metalover]: Well. I'll show you the 3 years before the Mental Blackout. But only this part! Otherwise I won't answer for anything! And then you'll tell me the location of my companions? Do we agree on that?
[DarkLurk]: That's fine with me!

<color=#RED>*** Transfering memories from 2166 to 2169. ***</color></color>

[DarkLurk]: My god this degree of accuracy is not possible...
[E-metalover]: Are you satisfied?
[DarkLurk]: Wait...
[E-metalover]: What do you mean wait?

<color=#RED>*** Transfering all memories from 2147 to 2171 (today). ***</color>

[E-metalover]: You little parasite! I told you only the 3 years before the ...
[DarkLurk]: Wait wait wait! You don't understand ! Those memories aren't yours!
[E-metalover]: What?
[DarkLurk]: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have done that. I've seen your life, and I can recognize false memories when I see ones. I can explain some things to you if you spare me... Yes, I also know who you are now, and I recognize that this gives you some leverage in the negotiation...
[E-metalover]: Speak. Speak quickly. Speak before I get tired of listening to you, your life has never been so close to end.
[DarkLurk]: I... I... all of your memories from the day you were born until the day of the Mental Blackout were entirely made up... This is the most advanced memory forging I have ever seen! There are no inconsistencies, just the right amount of doubt, the right amount of uncertainty to simulate real human memories. Everything is perfect! The person who created this backstory is simply on a whole other level. And I know you're wondering why you're not referenced and why you remember the Mental Blackout ...
[E-metalover]: Go on.
[DarkLurk]: It's because your memories of that time are the last ones that have been forged. You were born on the day of the Mental Blackout Ema.
[E-metalover]: Continue.
[DarkLurk]: You... are not human. You are an Artificial Intelligence.
