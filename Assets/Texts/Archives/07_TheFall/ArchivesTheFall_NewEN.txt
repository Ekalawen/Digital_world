[Ema Etlover]: It wasn't the CRINM... You know what? I'm not even surprised anymore.
[Morgensoul*]: A simulation within a simulation. Just the usual. And we only went down two levels.
[Ema Etlover]: Actually the CR1NM with a 1 is one of your little inventions, right?
[Morgensoul*]: Yeah. We took one of the official programs and we kind of ... reworked it a little bit in our own way.
[Ema Etlover]: Yeah, I realized that when I realized that it was ... a little too easy. And what was the Purge()?
[Morgensoul*]: The Purges(). That, unfortunately, is the reality. This is the process that the CRINM uses to destroy our free will and to ensure total control over humanity. And this is why the CRINM must fall, no matter what. But before that, we have a little test to do!
[Ema Etlover]: Haven't we done enough already?
[Morgensoul*]: This one is a little different. It's called the Turing Test.
[Ema Etlover]: Isn't it the one which is used for differentiating a human from an AI? Are you serious? Is that really necessary?
[Morgensoul*]: That's right, and yes it's necessary: this case has happened before. Since we are all reduced to the state of an interface capable of manipulating a digital puppet in the Mesh, you could very well be an AI, and we would have no way of realizing it, except with the Turing Test. I introduce you to Contrast01, he will be your examiner. And this will train him a little bit by the way.

[Contrast01]: Hi Ema! Morg, do we have to use that damn 200 year old test? It might be enough to check if it respects the 3 Laws of AI, right? All AIs have to respect them normally, it's written into their core.
[Morgensoul*]: No, it won't be enough. These 3 fucking Laws of AI are fine, but if it was given a strong enough order, then to obey the second law, it can break the others!
[Contrast01]: That makes sense... Well. Ema, are you ready?
[Ema Etlover]: Uhh I never said I was ok with that.
[Morgensoul*]: Refusing is also what an AI would say. Refusing is failing.
[Ema Etlover]: I guess I have no choice...
[Morgensoul*]: We always have the choice.
[Ema Etlover]: ... Then go ahead Contrast.
[Contrast01]: Great, thanks! :)

<color=#RED>*** Beginning of the Turing Test. ***</color>

[Contrast01]: Hello Ema.
[Ema Etlover]: Hello Contrast. Or should I say Examiner?
[Contrast01]: Whatever you like. Can you calculate 111111 * 111111?
[Ema Etlover]: Of course! That's 12345654321.
[Contrast01]: That was way too fast for a human...
[Ema Etlover]: Haha don't worry! I have a language recognition program running in the background to save me from recurring and tedious little tasks. I thought that was common among netrunners...
[Contrast01]: Uh, I don't think so...
[Morgensoul*]: Yes it is, I use one too. Come on Contrast, focus on the test.
[Contrast01]: Okay then ... what was the first question I asked Ema?
[Ema Etlover]: You asked Morg if we had to use the Turing Test to find out if I was an AI or a human.
[Contrast01]: Good point! Most AIs are limited to the test! That proves you have a long-term memory. Let's continue. Ais c3 ke you know the 3 Laws of AI ?
[Contrast01]: Good point! Most AIs are limited to the test! That proves you have a long-term memory. Let's continue. Ais c3 ke you know the 3 Laws of AI ?
[Ema Etlover]: Haha I can see what you are trying to do. But only a prehistoric AI would be confused by typos today. I put you a link to what the net says:

<color=#ELECTRIC_BLUE>The 3 Laws of AI:
1) An AI cannot harm a human being under the control of the CRINM or, remaining passive, leave that human being exposed to danger.
2) An AI must obey orders given by humans under the control of the CRINM, unless such orders contradict the first law.
3) An AI must protect its existence to the extent that such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.</color>

[Contrast01]: Uh... I'm a little embarrassed Ema, but these are not the 3 Laws of AI. I thought all Netrunners had heard of them...
[Ema Etlover]: Huh, what? What are you talking about? Of course they're the Laws of AI!
[Contrast01]: No, it clearly says "The 3 Laws of Robotics". They are old and obsolete now.
[Ema Etlover]: But it doesn't say that! Even the body text mentions AIs, not robots!
[Contrast01]: Actually I wonder if you can even tell the difference between a robot and an AI?
[Ema Etlover]: I advise you not to play with me #ID105315321. One more insinuation and I promise you that the CRINM will soon know about your little number!
[Contrast01]: Haha calm down! That was part of the test! You were right, Morg, humans are quick to respond to a little teasing. If you were a machine, you wouldn't have had a sense of individuality, an ego, and the ability to get so angry. Plus you were about to break the first of the AI Laws. So you're not an AI.
[Ema Etlover]: Even if I had been an AI, I could have harmed you. You are not a member of the CRINM.
[Contrast01]: Before I was.
