[Ema Etlover]: Everything is so quiet, so still, so peaceful... Shit, I feel like I'm in a dream. Whereas all my life I've only ever lived in a simulation... It's so strange.
[Ema Etlover]: I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, like I've finally escaped the gaze of someone following my every move... I feel serene, whole ... free!

[E-metalover]: Commµtator, where are the identifiers Contraste01, V1P3R and WolfvØre?
[Commµtato<b></b>r]: I do not have that information.
[E-metalover]: Do you even know if they reached the Parallel Web like I did?
[Commµtato<b></b>r]: I do not have that information.
[E-metalover]: Great. And... is it possible to get back to the Mesh?
[Commµtato<b></b>r]: The corresponding Commµtator on the Mesh side is not responding. Return trip is currently impossible.
[E-metalover]: At least the plan went as planned, the Matrix must have collapsed. The CRINM will not follow us. Well, I don't know much about this huge place yet, but I have to find the others!
