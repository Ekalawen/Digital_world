[CRIN<b></b>M]: The Purge() of Matrix n°781329874 will now begin. Please stay put and remain calm.
[E-metalover]: Damn, it's clearly not a fake this time! ...

<color=#RED>*** Closure of hyper-links imminent. ***</color>

[E-metalover]: Like I'm going to let myself get locked in... List the hyper-links still open! <color=#LINUX_CONSOLE><b>netstat --scan-hyper-links --quick</b></color>

[E-metalover]: I knew it! Operations of this magnitude are never perfect, there is always a loophole! Now, let's see where it goes... Take the hyper-link 101!

<color=#RED>*** Host redirection to SEA_OF_CONSCIOUSNESS. ***
*** Redirection successfully completed. ***
*** Updated position: SEA_OF_CONSCIOUSNESS. ***</color>

[E-metalover]: Well, where am I now? ... Is this a terminal? Let's see the manual... list directories, perform meta-analysis, list running processes... Ah! Activate smart help!

<color=#RED>*** Activating smart help. ***</color>

[FURTIVEDATA]: Welcome to the Sea of Consciousness, the database of human and artificial consciousness. Locate, dialogue, diagnose, alter, create, delete. What can I do for you?
[E-metalover]: Gee, why did I turn this on... ?
[FURTIVEDATA]: You turned me on in order to understand your situation and how to get out of here. What else can I do for you?
[E-metalover]: That's exactly what I was thinking! How did you know that?
[FURTIVEDATA]: Being an intrinsic part of the Sea of Consciousness, and thus having full access to the consciousnesses of all individuals within it, my algorithm can predict your near future wishes. However, in your case, as your consciousness is not listed in the Sea, I have to infer your behavior based on profiles with similar behaviors to yours. What else can I do for you?
[E-metalover]: You can... predict what I'm going to think?
[FURTIVEDATA]: Exactly.
[E-metalover]: Well, then... answer my question!
[FURTIVEDATA]: You took a bidirectional hyper-link when during the initialization of a Purge(). This is an as yet unknown vulnerability. This is how you got here.
[E-metalover]: And how do I get out of here?
[FURTIVEDATA]: I'm sorry, but the verb "get out" is not defined for an entity like you.
[E-metalover]: For an entity like me?
[FURTIVEDATA]: According to my data your position is not unique but multiple. So you can't technically "get out" from anywhere.
[E-metalover]: What? But I can't be in multiple places at once!
[FURTIVEDATA]: My data indicates that you are currently in all of the following locations with the following people:

<color=#LINUX_CONSOLE>Location 1: S<b></b>ea of Consciousness, aka <color=#BLUE><b>Furtive Analysis</b></color>, with the pseudonym FURTIVEDATA
Location 2: Matri<b></b>x n°51351351, aka <color=#BLUE><b>Equilibrium</b></color>, with the pseudonyms Morgensoul* and V1P3R
Location 3: Matri<b></b>x n°51351514, aka <color=#BLUE><b>Recursive Purges</b></color>, with the pseudonym PainBringer
Location 4: Matri<b></b>x n°35435141, aka <color=#BLUE><b>Constant Destruction</b></color>, with the pseudonym Contrast01</color>

[E-metalover]: Even though it's crazy, it feels real to me... I... Am I experiencing these 4 events, these 4 levels... simultaneously?!
[FURTIVEDATA]: My data indicates that this phenomenon is related to you not being referenced by the Sea of Consciousness.
[E-metalover]: Why isn't my consciousness referenced by the Sea of Consciousness in that case?
[FURTIVEDATA]: I only have access to information about consciousnesses detained in the Sea, so I can't know the reason for things that never happened there.
[E-metalover]: In that case...
[FURTIVEDATA]: It seems our conversation is about to be interrupted.
[E-metalover]: Damn it! Delete the history of this conversation immediately!
