[Morgensoul**]: E-metalover do you copy?
[E-metalover]: Morgensoul*? Morg is that you?
[Morgensoul**]: Yes, well more or less.
[E-metalover]: What do you mean "more or less"? Morgensoul* was captured by the CRINM. He should be dead! So who are you!?
[Morgensoul**]: What you say is correct. Morgensoul* was captured by the CRINM. And he's probably dead, or close to it.
[E-metalover]: You didn't answer my question!
[Morgensoul**]: I am his successor, Morgensoul**. I succeed Morgensoul* in the same way that he succeeded the first Morgensoul.
[E-metalover]: You... succeed him? What's with the ...
[Morgensoul**]: Look. I've always been, well Morgensoul* has always been extremely cautious. And realistic. He knew that sooner or later he would be caught by the CRINM, and that the Backup Firewall would be of no use to him. So he set up a system. A backup system.
[E-metalover]: To backup what?
[Morgensoul**]: To backup a human being.
[E-metalover]: A backup system... of a human being? It can't be...
[Morgensoul**]: Technically it can. To simplify things, our real human brain can be modeled as a set of 80 billion neurons in well-determined electrical states. If we are able to capture all the states of all the neurons at a given time, and thus of the brain as a whole, then we are able to make a backup.
[E-metalover]: Don't tell me that ... this backup ... he used it for ...
[Morgensoul**]: To create me. Initially the backup was digital, stored on servers in the Mesh, but when Morgensoul* was captured by PainBringer, he triggered the protocol, and that backup was injected into the brain of a real human being. Then that human being was connected to the digital shell in front of you. Morgensoul**. Me.
[E-metalover]: You are... a digital copy... immersed in a human body? So you're a... biological AI?
[Morgensoul**]: Don't mess with me Ema. I have human memories, I think and live in a human body, so I am a human!
[E-metalover]: Is this really the definition of a human being? Is that enough? Necessary? Couldn't we imagine a special case where...
[Morgensoul**]: If I'm not human, then none of the biological brains controlling digital puppets in this world are!
[E-metalover]: Haha you're right! But I still wonder... what is a human being really?
[Morgensoul**]: Do we really need a precise definition? Does the label I'm given have so much importance that I don't even know who I really am?
[E-metalover]: You are right too! Then I wonder... Why did Morgensoul* do this... I don't understand... he will never do him any good! He is dead!
[Morgensoul**]: There are few people in this world who have such strong convictions as h... as ours. For him, his convictions were more important than his own existence. Morgensoul* sacrificed himself for his convictions. He sacrificed himself for this idea. To bring down the CRINM.
[E-metalover]: Yes, it's true that he was like that. And... that human body you used... it couldn't be agreeing... did you... kill it?
[Morgensoul**]: He was dead anyway. His virtual shell had been killed. In the Ark, they were going to dump his body. I just convinced them that this body didn't need to be recycled right away. And I took his place.
[E-metalover]: That's genius! ... I'm glad to have you back Morg, don't doubt it for a second. But when I think about it, from my own perspective, am I supposed to have the same relationship with you that I had with Morgensoul*? Only because you have his memories? To you I am the Ema of your memories, but you are not the Morg of mine.
[Morgensoul**]: That, Ema, is your choice. I once was Morgensoul*. But not anymore.
