Break the illusion.
Now I must remember.

[E-metalover]:
These memories...
Are they mine?
Are they fake?
Are they human?
Are they new?
Does it matter?
Should I destroy them?
Are they a passtime?
Am I my memories?

DarkLurk ...
WillWatcher...
They may have been telling the truth.
But I can't accept it.
I can't get over it.
A being of flesh and blood.
A being of iron and screen.

[E-metalover]:
I can remember every detail.
I feel them as if I had lived them.
Maybe I'm just an electronic mail.
I'm just another never-convinced golem.
Just another CRINM figurine.
Is this my feminine origin?
Just another gamine made machine.
