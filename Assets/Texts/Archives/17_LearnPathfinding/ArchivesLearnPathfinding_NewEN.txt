[V1P3R]: Damn it we were too late! All the Commµtators have already been deactivated. It's over.
[WolfvØre]: No, there's still a solution. We have to reactivate them.
[E-metalover]: Reactivate them? But with what power source? It's not like we're the CRINM, we don't have all the resources in the world at our fingertips!
[WolfvØre]: We're H@ckers, what we don't have, we take. We're going to hijack an already existing energy source.
[E-metalover]: Yes, but here, the only source nearby is the Reality Engine of this Matrix. If we hijack it, the Matrix will lose power and collapse! It'll probably kill hundreds of people! People will die Boss!
[WolfvØre]: People! Do you really consider these future empty souls as living beings? They are all just puppets waiting to be exploited. Cattle. A resource. And right now, this resource is needed, so we'll use it.
[Contrast01]: I can't support such an action.
[WolfvØre]: Contrast, Ema, I understand you. It hurts at first, but you have to think in the long run. Until the CRINM is stopped, hundreds of people will be purged every day. EVERY DAY! And if we get caught now, if this is the end of the H@ckers today, then who knows how long before someone finally decides to end the CRINM? By then, everyone will have already been legumized. We're talking about hundreds of millions of people. I know it's hard, it sounds monstrous, but in the end a sacrifice of 0.0001% is negligible.
[Contrast01]: But I don't want to make a sacrifice.
[WolfvØre]: To live is to choose. To choose is to give up. To give up is to sacrifice. To live is to sacrifice.
[Contrast01]: No ! Living is not killing others ! We are talking about humans here WolfvØre !
[WolfvØre]: No! We are talking about future sheeps! And if it is necessary to decimate the herd to advance, then we will be the wolves!
[Contrast01]: ...
[V1P3R]: There will be another problem too. If we use the Reality Engine and the Matrix collapses, the Commµtators will be completely destroyed, and we'll never be able to get back. It's a one-way trip.
[WolfvØre]: Even if it is, it's either that or the end. And if you ask me, these are certainly not the last Commµtators, the CRINM must have more than one backup center. We'll locate it in time.
[V1P3R]: Okay. So let me recap: we hijack the energy from the Reality Engine. We reactivate a Commµtator with it. We initialize it properly to aim at the Parallel Web. We all teleport there. This Matrix collapses. There is no turning back. And we hope to make a minimum of collateral victims...
[Contrast01]: I'm sorry, but I can't tolerate what you're about to do. I'm sorry. I really am.
[WolfvØre]: Contrast...don't make me do this.

*** Alert triggered. ***
*** Hostile intruders detected. ***
*** Initializing three-dimensional maze. ***

[E-metalover]: What the hell happened? Have they spotted us yet?

*** Deactivation of a user. ***

[WolfvØre]: No it was Contrast01 that cracked and alerted them. I had to stop it.
[E-metalover]: What? What do you mean you stopped him?
[V1P3R]: He deactivated it Ema... He cut the link between his body and his digital shell.
[E-metalover]: And you want to leave him here? Leave him in the grasp of the CRINM?
[WolfvØre]: Look, we only have a few seconds left before we're separated and plunged into this labyrinth. You know the objective. I'm sending the Pathfinder() program to your terminals so you can get localize yourself and we can regroup...

*** Separation of the intruders from the hostile group. ***
*** Three-dimensional maze operational. ***
*** Closure of the access to the Reality Engine in progress ... ***
*** Approach of the CRINM imminent. ***

[E-metalover]: I can't believe it! How could it go so ****** ** so fast?? Okay... stay calm. I have the Pathfinder() with me. Find Contrast, then stick to the plan. If this Parallel Web really exists, this is now my only way out!
