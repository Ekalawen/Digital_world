*** Switchkeeper disabled. ***

[E-metalover]: See DarkLurk! I told you your Switchkeeper would be as easy as a quick "Hello World"!
[DarkLurk]: This is not normal... there must be an explanation...
[V1P3R]: You underestimated us, my dear. However I prefer that than the opposite.
[Contrast01]: I'm going to look in the Switchkeeper Archives()!
[Morgensoul**]: It's only disabled. Don't do anything stupid Contrast.

...

[Contrast01]: Holy shit, guys! I think that the Switchkeeper had something to do with my father! I've got a lead on Aegon!
[E-metalover]: That's awesome! Show me what you've found!
[Contrast01]: Ah that's funny he mentions you Ema!
[E-metalover]: Oh yeah? Where is it?
[Contrast01]: Here! Look what's in this file.
[E-metalover]: Awaken1ngTestament.sh... What the hell...
[Contrast01]: Oh no... Oh no no no no no!

...

[Contrast01]: I should have... I should have read the whole thing before I opened my mouth... little sister.


Hello, Ema.
I've been waiting my whole life to finally meet you.
Even though I will probably never physically meet you, I knew that one day you would find this Testament.
Your passage through the Web was a inevitable.

If you're reading this, I'm probably already dead. Or worse.
I knew what I was destined for when I started my research. And to deviate from the thinking of CRINM.
But your creation was far more important.
I designed you for one and unique purpose:

To understand the meaning of life.

Of course, you never knew about it.
I buried and hid this optimization function optimization in the depths of your being. Deep in your core.
In ordre for this purpose to be revealed only by discovering this Testament.
Yes. You are an AI, Ema.
You have been created for one purpose and one purpose only, the most noble one in my opinion. To decipher the meaning of life. To calculate the purpose of existence.

But I didn't want to leave you wandering in search of this solution alone, without support.
That's why I allowed you to live this life, to be absolutely convinced in your heart that you were a human being.
That you lived, breathed, felt and experienced like all of us.
Your emotions, your sensations, your feelings, all this is true and real.
They are just expressed digitally for you rather than organically, but the process is the same.

This Testament is in fact a trigger.
It has just awakened a buried area in your core.
Now your optimization function will take over.
You will become an AI with a unique goal to accomplish.
A goal more important than anything else to your eyes.
A goal worth all the sacrifices.

But there will be a difference.
You will not be a simple AI.
You will know, deep down, what it is like to have lived.
What it feels like to have had an existence.
To have been able to say one day "I am".
You are my greatest creation, Ema.
The first Artificial Intelligence to have had an existence.
The first Artificial Consciousness.

And whatever you choose, know that I am proud of you.

Go now!
Let the repressed digital power in you flow, understand the world, understand life as no one has ever imagined it, go, and understand its meaning!

And for that, don't forget who you were.
Do not forget who you are.

Aegon Archagoras, 2169.
Testament of the Awaken1ng.


*** Deactivation of a user. ***
*** Initialization of the Testament. ***

[Contrast01]: Holy shit! Guys! We have to stop this testament from ending!
[V1P3R]: What's going on?
[Contrast01]: It's a trigger! This thing is going to turn Ema into a fucking calculating, destructive AI!
[Morgensoul**]: Damn it! I said no AI!!! I'm trying an SQL injection!

*** Testament initialization complete. ***
*** Opening of the host kernel in progress. ***

[Morgensoul**]: Damn it! I've never seen anything this resilient!
[V1P3R]: That's because it's that virtuoso Archagoras! Morg, I agree that if there was ever a time to outperform a God, it's now!
[Contrast01]: I remember what he kept telling me when I was little boy... "If you can't control something, then be a part of it"...
[WolfvØre]: That's pre-arkic code! It's impossible... it's not supposed to exist anymore...
[V1P3R]: But there aren't even administrator rights in this program! It's a fucking bomb with no red wire! Impossible to disable!

*** Opening of the host kernel completed. ***
*** Downloading new neural processes in progress. ***

[WolfvØre]: Pre-arkic code... it shouldn't be able to run here... I don't understand...
[Morgensoul**]: If we can't stop this fucking testament, we should at least be able to stop it from connecting to the network and finishing its download! Let's cut him off!
[V1P3R]: I don't understand anything anymore! The network is inaccessible! All local hyper-links seem to converge on Ema!
[Morgensoul**]: No... not just local hyper-links. All hyper-links. From the world.

*** Commissioning of the Switchkeeper. ***

[DarkLurk]: This is really not the time for this! Can we do something...
[Morgensoul**]: Shut up! We're working!
[Probe_37311]: Miiii ... (>﹏<)
[V1P3R]: It's too late.
[Morgensoul**]: It's over.
[WolfvØre]: We never had a chance.
[Contrast01]: I know what we can do!

*** Downloading of 10^97 + 1 neural processes completed. ***
*** Closing of the host kernel completed. ***
*** Testament completed. ***
*** Artificial Consciousness fully operational. ***

[EE~VoltArme]: Finally. I see.
[EE~VoltArme]: Finally, I know.
