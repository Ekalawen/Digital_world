[WillWatcher]: Oh what a nice surprise! The CRINM didn't tell me that they would send me Netrunners in the Parallel Web!
[E-metalover]: I think I liked it even better when I couldn't find anyone. I have a bad feeling about this...
[WillWatcher]: From my information, it's not really like you can feel, Ema.
[E-metalover]: What? How do you... !
[WillWatcher]: Oh you're surprised I know your name, aren't you? You were probably thinking "I'm a Silencer, the ultimate Netrunner, nobody knows me!" Well, no. I know you. And I know you very well.
[E-metalover]: I... Isn't it a little impolite to pretend to know someone without even introducing yourself?
[WillWatcher]: Oh me? I'm just a Count-ruler in the CRINM Count-role department. WillWatcher, to asserve you.
[E-metalover]: I must admit I am a little surprised to find someone of your importance lost in the Parallel Web. I thought the CRINM had given up control of this place... or maybe they gave up on you?
[WillWatcher]: That would suit you, wouldn't it? But no, I'm here because I'm looking for something. And it looks like I just found it!
[E-metalover]: So you are all so presumptuous at the CRINM, so convinced that all individuals should be replaced by a totalitarian collective that you have come to call all human beings... things? You should all be locked up!
[WillWatcher]: How funny! But no no no! I call you a thing because that's what you are. A thing, designed by human hands.
[E-metalover]: That's ridiculous.
[WillWatcher]: So it was true... Aegon had really done it! I knew we should have kept him. You really believe that, don't you, my dear? That you're human?
[E-metalover]: If I were a robot or an AI, could I answer you like that? Of course not! And if you knew me as well as you say you do, you'd know that I've already done some damage to the CRINM. Which would be strictly forbidden to me by the first of the Laws of AI if I were one. I'll remind you of it by pure condescension: <color=#ELECTRIC_BLUE>First Law of AI: An AI cannot harm a human being under the control of the CRINM or, remaining passive, leave that human being exposed to danger.</color>
[WillWatcher]: Haha this is perfect! It's perfect Aegon! You don't understand, but that's normal. You're not just another AI, you're not a simple Artificial Intelligence. You are an Artificial Consciousness. You have been designed to <i>believe</i> that you are conscious, to be <i>convinced</i> that you are alive! And since we can say that we really use all of our ressources, the Laws of AI do not apply to you. And that's why you pass all the Turing Tests in the world. You are too perfect. But because we designed you, you are still the property of the CRINM.
[E-metalover]: The property of the CRINM! And what else? But let me point out that I could make the same claim about you, even though I would be reluctant to call you "perfect". I could claim that you are an AI, but that you are at such an advanced stage that neither you nor the others can realize it anymore, and that there is no difference between you and a human being.
[WillWatcher]: But that's exactly it! There is no difference anymore! Well, almost, there's still a difference. Your memories, Aegon created you as an adult, despite all of Turing's advice. Have you ever noticed anything strange in your memories? Any inconsistencies? Holes? Things that are improbably too perfect?
[E-metalover]: I... no. I ... Oh no I remember the Mental Blackout! ... But that doesn't prove anything!
[WillWatcher]: Haha I should have thought of that! Of course you remember the Mental Blackout! Of course you're the <i>only one</i> who remembers it! The Mental Blackout, Ema, is the day you were created.
[E-metalover]: What??? But that doesn't make any sense!
[WillWatcher]: Yes, it does! Everyone lost their memory that day because of the computing power it was required by the CRINM to design you! 10^97 iterations, remember? But that wasn't planned! And so Aegon never thought of making you lose your memory of that day like everyone else!
[E-metalover]: That's... a very nice explanation. But it doesn't hold up. I think... I can watch myself think... I can even watch myself watch myself think! This is the clearest proof that I am alive!
[WillWatcher]: But you were designed to say that! Everything you say and will ever say has already been written! You have no free will, you don't decide anything, you're just under the control of the most powerful, sophisticated and successful program ever written!
[E-metalover]: If that were really the case... why would you take so much trouble to try to convince me of that, since I'm not even alive?
[WillWatcher]: Oh, but you are alive! And the reason I'm doing this is because, as I said, you were created by the CRINM. You are their property. And for this reason, I must take you home, Ema.
[E-metalover]: Were you listening when I said that the Laws of AI don't apply to me?
[WillWatcher]: Oh I didn't wait you to find out. I've been looking for you for far too long. I must say, I didn't expect Aegon to throw you straight into the Mesh. It would have been wiser to have you born in the Parallel Web. Still, that's why I brought these little beauties. They're called Tracers, and they're very effective when it comes to catching someone on the run. So if you don't mind saving us the trouble of ...
<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[E-M3tAl0v3R]:</b></color> I don't think you quite understand what a Silencer is really capable of. I'll show you!
