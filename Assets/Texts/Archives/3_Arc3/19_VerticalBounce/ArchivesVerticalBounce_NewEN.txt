Here, everything is so vast, so big... and yet so empty! I feel this lightness, this kind of weightlessness, this fading oppression!
[Ema Etlover]:
No matter how much I scan with my Pathfinder() in all directions, I never find anyone... Or am I not looking in the right place? I have to change the way I see the world, change my frame of reference... raise my level of consciousness!

[Ema Etlover]:
I feel like everything is reversed! But as everything is, I have the feeling that it doesn't change anything. I function the same, I can feel it, yet... yet I perceive everything so differently. The digital signals that my digital envelope sends to my brain... it's like a filter is applied to it. Dilating. Contracting. Distorting and reversing. I think the basic signal is the same, but I feel it differently. I can't think of another word. Differently... or maybe it was in the Mesh that I felt things differently... and here I finally feel it the way I should have felt it... normally.

[Ema Etlover]:
I remember feeling like I was in a dream when I came in. Or maybe all this time the Mesh was my dream and I just finally woke up. It's paradoxical. The second I was injected into the digital simulation of the Ark, I was dreaming, and yet this dream... these dreams... have always been my only reality. Some say that reality is what continues to exist when you stop believing in it. By opposition, a dream would be what disappears when we stop believing in it. So none of this is a dream... is it? None of this will ever disappear. It's all too real. This simulation is and will always be my only reality.
