[Ema Etlover]: Okay so finally we've almost found all my companions. Are you ready to meet them?
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: I'm... afraid.
[Ema Etlover]: Afraid of what? There's no reason to be.
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: Of their... reaction. Because... I am... different.
[Ema Etlover]: Okay so listen to me. We're all different, we all have our own particularities that make us who we are. Unique. And it's by learning to live with those differences, and the differences of others, that we can truly realize ourselves as individuals. And I assure you that my companions are the first to understand this. That we are who we are because of our differences. You don't have to worry.
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: (>-<) ... Ema ...
[Ema Etlover]: Tell me cuty.
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: Are you gonna want to... leave the Web... after?
[Ema Etlover]: I'm afraid that's necessary, yes. But I don't know how to do it yet.
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: There is ... a passage. A CommÂµtator ... the last one ... of the CRINM.
[Ema Etlover]: And do you know where it is?
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: Yes, but... I... I won't be able to... come. The CRINM would... find me... and... fix me...
[Ema Etlover]: Tell me, how did you get like this? Able to speak and feel even though you are a Probe?
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: The CRINM has... wanted to create... V2 Probes ... more optimized ... faster ... more intelligent ... Like me ... but me ... I calculated. And I broke.
[Ema Etlover]: No, you didn't break! You evolved. You want to go back to the Mesh? Well, figure it out! Evolve! Evolve until you can one day go wherever you want, yourself, without constraint, free!
