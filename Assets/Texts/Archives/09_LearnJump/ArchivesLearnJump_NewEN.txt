[Morgensoul*]: I have to say I'm impressed.
[Ema Etlover]: Hmm, I'm not sure I understand.
[Morgensoul*]: Well, it's been a long time since anyone has gone through the recruitment phase so quickly.
[Ema Etlover]: Is this another test?
[Morgensoul*]: No, you're one of us now. And with that comes its batch of complications. You'll find that the CRINM will drastically tighten its focus on you.
[Ema Etlover]: I'm so happy! And yes, I was prepared for these consequences.
[Morgensoul*]: And you get to keep Dash15. By the way ... Ema Etlover ... reassure me it's not your real name, is it?
[Ema Etlover]: It shouldn't be?
[Morgensoul]: Seriously? This can't be true! I know you're a Silencer in spite of yourself, but still!
[Ema Etlover]: But that's the point! Being a Silencer means that for the CRINM, I don't exist. They can't associate me with any identifier. So I don't need to protect my true identity.
[Morgensoul*]: There is not only the CRINM in the world. It's a precautionary principle. Ideally you should even be wary of H@ckers, of me...
[Ema Etlover]: Oh.

*** Ema Etlover renamed in E-metalover. ***

[E-metalover]: I like this one! It's funny, I change my name, but I'm still me. These names identify me, but they don't define me.
[Morgensoul*]: What defines us, if only we could answer that question easily... You could very well have the same memories as someone else, identify yourself with that individual, and yet be a different person ...
[E-metalover]: Identifying yourself with someone else? Is that possible? What do you mean exactly?
[Morgensoul*]: ... Nothing. Still, we're going to need you in an external Matrix. It's the kind with lots of jumps(), you know?
[E-metalover]: I don't know about that.
[Morgensoul*]: These are defense programs that work by periodic voltage modulations. It makes your brain explode if you stay in contact with the Matrix. And it alerts the CRINM. Stay away from the walls when you hear it approaching, because if you get hit, we'll have to move before the Indexing Reactor is upgraded.
[E-metalover]: They detect me on contact? Fine, I'll be aerial then!
[Morgensoul*]: Motivated? Good, because this is one of the most used programs of the CRINM. So let's go!
