[Morgensoul**]: Have the two newcomers passed the battery of tests it order to join us? And we don't accept AIs. So a Probe...
[Probe_37311]: Ema... (T-T) ... they are scaring me ...
[E-metalover]: She's a particular Probe, she's awake. She feels emotions. I couldn't leave her behind. She comes with us.
[Morgensoul**]: It's out of ...
[Contrast01]: Morg! She could be super useful! Imagine all the information about the CRINM she could give us!
[V1P3R]: Let's just hack her for that.
[DarkLurk]: If I may say so, I do have a feeling that her memories are intimately connected to the reason for her awakening. If you hack her, you run the risk of breaking the reason of her consciousness. And lose all her memories at the same time.
[Morgensoul**]: And who is he?
[Contrast01]: Yes, who is he?
[DarkLurk]: Lord DarkLurk is also pleased to meet you!
[E-metalover]: He's a local soul who has proven to be as... deceitful as he is useful. He's a pain, but nevertheless seems to understand his precarious situation. He's going to stay quiet. Won't he?
[DarkLurk]: Uhh... of course...

...

[V1P3R]: Personally... I don't know if I'm more surprised by the fact that the meta-girl brought back a Probe or by the fact that Morgensoul** is with us.
[Contrast01]: That's right! You made it through Morg! You survived!
[V1P3R]: Can't you see? He didn't. This is Morgensoul**.
[E-metalover]: Morg told me how he transferred his consciousness into the body of a guy who was already dead! It's amazing!
[V1P3R]: Really? And did he tell you that he was already dead because he killed him?
[E-metalover]: Wait... what?
[Morgensoul**]: He was a fucking corpse! He killed himself after a failed Purge! I didn't do anything to that poor guy. It was just body recycling!
[V1P3R]: How about that! Are you trying to improve now? It must be a little more morally bearable than what you did to the other guy. The one before. The one Morgensoul* lived in.
[Morgensoul**]: I saved that guy! He was doomed by the CRINM! Without me he would be dead another billions of times! He owes me his life!
[V1P3R]: And did you ask the poor guy's permission? He wasn't dead yet as far as I know.
[Morgensoul**]: Did I ask his permission? PainBringer had been torturing him for over 10 minutes! He must have been suffering in thousands of different simulations for over 10,000,000 years! I fucking set him free! He would have given up his body to me jumping for joy in exchange of what I did for him. I did him a fucking favor!
[V1P3R]: Oh you may have saved the simulations, but the original guy, him, was going to be released. And you knew that! And under the guise of saving him and his billions of simulations, you took the liberty of killing him to replace him when you needed to?
[Morgensoul**]: Exactly! And the first asshole that tell me that between the time I saved him and the time I took his place, this guy didn't owe me anything, I'll kill him! Did I make myself clear? I'll blow him up and chop him up into quintillion bytes, I'll pass it all through a fucking hash function and I'll hand him over to the CRINM! Capiche?
[V1P3R]: We are H@ckers damn it! We have the power to bend space, time and people to our will, but we must never ever play God like you did!
[Probe_37311]: Stooooooooop! ┻━┻ ︵\(`Д')/︵ ┻━┻

...

[Contrast01]: Is it over? Are you calmed down? Are you done with your endless debate for today? What's done is done. Can we move on now?
[V1P3R]: We'll talk about this later, it wasn't the right time for this Morg.
[Morgensoul**]: Yeah, you're right... let's move on.
[Probe_37311]: (>^-^)>┬─┬
[Contrast01]: Perfect! So I'm taking the opportunity while I can. Ema is an AI. Like that it's said. Now...
[Morgensoul**]: What the hell is this bullshit?
[Contrast01]: No, you've used up your speaking time, that's enough. We hacked it to check her with V1P3R, she's safe.
[E-metalover]: Wait... why don't I remember your hack? You were supposed to find the function I was coded for, and you didn't even tell me! What the hell is this!?
[Contrast01]: We didn't find anything Ema. Nothing but your childhood and the purity of your quest. It did piss off V1P3R, but none of your memories show any optimization function. You didn't hide anything from us. We thought it would be more pleasant for you to get rid of the painful memory of the analysis of your memory ...
[DarkLurk]: If you forgive me for you know what Ema, I might be able to find the memories they erased for you if you're interested!
[E-metalover]: No, that's okay. Save your haggling for others. I let you do this because I trusted you. But it looks like I'll have to adjust my judgment. Don't ever make a decision about me for me again. Not ever again!
