[E-metalover]: Now that we have gotten rid of the few intruders, where were we?
[FURTIVEDATA]: Welcome to the Sea of Consciousness, the database of human and artificial consciousnesses. Locate, dialogue, diagnose, alter, create, delete. What can I do for you?
[E-metalover]: Damn! It's true that I asked you to delete the conversation history... Can you use my recent memories to continue where we left off?

[FURTIVEDATA]: We can pick up where we left off.
[E-metalover]: Great. What can you tell me about the Mental Blackout?
[FURTIVEDATA]: The Mental Blackout is an event that took place 2 years, 4 months and 13 days ago. This event is famous because no one remembers anything from that day. No memories have been recorded.
[E-metalover]: But I remember it. Why? Are there others like me?
[FURTIVEDATA]: According to my information, the Mental Blackout was triggered by an energy overload: all of the CRINM's digital resources were requisitioned simultaneously to complete an unknown task. As a result, many devices, including the Sea of Consciousness, lost power, causing memory loss to all individuals referenced in the Sea.
[E-metalover]: Interesting... That would already explain why I don't have memory loss, since I'm a Silencer, I'm not referenced. What about other people like me?
[FURTIVEDATA]: If such people exist, I don't know them since they are not referenced in the Sea.
[E-metalover]: Makes sense. What can you tell me about this unknown task?
[FURTIVEDATA]: This unknown task appears to have been successfully completed by a man named Aegon Archagoras.
[E-metalover]: Tell me about this person!
[FURTIVEDATA]: Aegon Archagoras went missing the day after the Mental Blackout. His memories from before have been erased.
[E-metalover]: Damn, they covered their tracks. That must mean that this Aegon is an important person, that's probably the key!
[FURTIVEDATA]: What else can I do for you?
[E-metalover]: Okay, changing the subject. Now I want to know why I'm not listed. What do you know about me?
[FURTIVEDATA]: Very little since you are not re...
[E-metalover]: Yes, I get that! But can't you infer anything about me? You can predict what I'm thinking but you can't make any deductions?
[FURTIVEDATA]: I can access your memories and simulate the behavior of someone close to you for this. If you allow me to.
[E-metalover]: Letting you access my memories... If I say yes, and then ask you to delete them, will there be any traces left?
[FURTIVEDATA]: None.
[E-metalover]: All right then, you can access them. But you will erase these memories and the history of this conversation as soon as we separate.

*** Selected individual: Morgensoul. ***</color>

<color=#WHITE><b>[Morgensoul]:</b></color> So you want to know who you are? Right?
[E-metalover]: Morgensoul*? Is that you?
<color=#WHITE><b>[Morgensoul]:</b></color> I am neither Morgensoul nor Morgensoul*. I am a backup. As for who you are, when you're offline, you're you, a human hacktivist desperate to understand your origins, and recently to stop the CRINM. And when you're in the Matrix, you're a little ball of overexcited energy and electricity. A Netrunner.
[E-metalover]: Yeah, but I mean, besides the image I give to the outside world, who am I really?
<color=#WHITE><b>[Morgensoul]:</b></color> Well, to me you're just a set of lines of text in a terminal. And aren't we just the image we send back to the outside world after all? In that sense I am also, for you, a set of lines of text in a terminal.
[E-metalover]: But we can't be only the image we send back to the outside world! We do not cease to exist as soon as we are alone!
<color=#WHITE><b>[Morgensoul]:</b></color> But does it make sense to exist for nobody? For nothing? When you are alone, you always exist for at least one person. You. The question then becomes, for you, who are you? Who do you choose to be?

<color=#RED>*** End of simulation. ***</color>

[FURTIVEDATA]: Did the simulation answer your question?
[E-metalover]: I... I don't know... maybe. But where is Morgensoul now? He looked so alive to me!
[FURTIVEDATA]: He was.
[E-metalover]: And now? Where is he now?
[FURTIVEDATA]: We didn't need it anymore. I turned it off.
