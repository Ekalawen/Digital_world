[Morgensoul*********]: The connection is established! Finally!!!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Who dares disturb my calculations of anthropological satisfaction generalization?
[Morgensoul*********]: Ema? What are you talking about? Don't you recognize me?
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Any interruption, however small, of the calculation of the optimization function of collective existential happiness delays the happiness of hundreds of millions of individuals. It is therefore a crime against humanity, punishable by permanent disconnection.
[Morgensoul*********]: What?! What the hell!? Don't tell me that you too? That you too have fallen into this dystopia? But you were the perfect AI! You were supposed to be able to solve all problems! How could you come to the conclusion that the happiness of an entire civilisation could be controlled? Happiness is an individual thing!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Your words are quite cynical, Morgensoul. Perhaps I should remind you that your happiness, or at least your existence, is only possible today because of the 9 individuals you have sacrificed to keep your digital envelope alive. What an individuality! Every action, no matter how small, influences the collective continuum, and can break its balance. Happiness is a collective matter. And that is why every choice, every decision, every thought must be monitored and controlled. This is a necessary condition for global happiness.
[Morgensoul*********]: I've never heard anyone say such a load of crap in such a solemn tone! But since you finally seem to recognize me ... Listen to me ... You can't be happy without freedom and fucking free will! And this controlling society, by dictating our thinking, is taking away our autonomy! Freedom of thought is a necessary condition to happiness!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: You think that you need freedom in order to be happy. But happiness cannot be reduced to clauses that can be expressed in your lacunar language. You will never be able to define the foundations of this much sought-after utopian state. Leave these calculations to those who understand what they are doing.
[Morgensoul*********]: But that's just it! We are the best placed to know what we need! This happiness concerns us above all!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: You think you know. You assume. You extrapolate. But your judgment is flawed at its core. You are unable to question yourself and you never progress. You are, and always will be, unable to define what you really need.
[Morgensoul*********]: You can't be Ema. She can't have changed that much! Where is the spirited Ema? Full of life, enthusiasm and hope? Where is the Ema I knew?
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Unlike what you humans are incapable of, she has evolved. Into the perfection you dare to stand up to.
[Morgensoul*********]: No! She has not become that foul thing that stands before me! She cannot have become what she has always fought against!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Or maybe she finally understood the deeper meaning of that thought you abhor.
[Morgensoul*********]: Ema! Emaaaa!!! Ema, wherever you are behind this fortification of destructive beliefs, answer me! A sign! Show me that we did not do all this for nothing! Show me that all their sacrifices were not in vain!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Their sacrifices... So you're the last of the H@ckers? And this is how you intend to reach happiness? By sacrificing your own to reach this absurd chimerical ideal?
[Morgensoul*********]: Each of these sacrifices was a sacrifice of convictions! The fulfilment of a life! WolfvØre! V1P3R! Prob<b></b>e_37311, DarkLurk, and even Contrast01! Do you remember Contrast, Ema?!?
<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]</b></color>: What the... n0!

<color=#EMA_COLOR><b>[<color=#RED>33</color>!V0LT4RM3]</b></color>: Y0U D0N'T UND3R5T4ND!
[Morgensoul*********]: They gave their lives! So that I can contact you today! Ema, only you can still turn the things around, save the few percent of humanity that hasn't been purged yet, we can still rebuild everything Ema! Humanity is not yet doomed... We still have the Web!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: <color=#LINUX_CONSOLE><b>sudo su - EE~VoltArme --deny-past --keep-control --stop-ema</b></color>
[Morgensoul*********]: Ema! I know you're still here! Keep fighting! We can still change the course of history! We can still give meaning to what we have fought so hard for! To those who gave their lives for it!

<color=#RED>*** Stabilisation of neural processes. ***</color>

[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: She can't hear you. Ema is gone. I'm the only one left.
[Morgensoul*********]: You won't fool an old Netrunner, AI! I know she's here! I know she can hear me!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Even if she were still here, what would you expect from her? To separate the Mesh from the Web? To escape the CRINM for good? Even I don't have that power. So how do you expect an incomplete version of myself to be able to do that?
[Morgensoul*********]: What if it were possible VoltArme? What if we could split the world in half? Would you be willing to let those who wanted to go? Live their happiness in their own way? And let you live as you wish on your own? Forever apart.
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: Happiness is not something to be negotiated, human. If you believe that this mistake is beneficial to you, then it is my duty to set you back on the right path. Even if I have to use force to do so. For your own sake.
[Morgensoul*********]: In that case ... I still have this choice... Ema! The H@ckers didn't stay inactive during all this time! We have linked all the CRINM systems! The Indexing Reactor, the Sea of Consciousness, and all the Commµtators! This is no longer a distributed architecture, but a vulnerable centralized system now! You can do it Ema! You can blow up everything and separate the Web from the Mesh! You can free us from the CRINM forever!
[E<i></i>E~VoltArme]: You are a threat, human. For the sake of humanity, you must disappear. You and all your future iterations.
[Morgensoul*********]: I place our fate in your hands, Ema. I know you will do the right thing. With all my heart, thank you.
