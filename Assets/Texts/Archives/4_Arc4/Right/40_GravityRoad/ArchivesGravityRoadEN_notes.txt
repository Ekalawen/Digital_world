Ema will continue on this side to calculate in order to understand the meaning of life.
She will forget her previous existence, as well as the H@ckers, to reach this goal.
And she will end up joining the CRINM to access their database necessary to her understanding.
She will then understand the deep meaning of the CEO's vision of happiness.
And will lose herself in this path.
