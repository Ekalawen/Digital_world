[PainBringer]: So your so-called friends are making you take all the risks while they run away? My poor girl. And you're stuck deep in the Matrix, face to face with a CRINM Purgator... me!
[E-metalover]: I chose to come here, knowing the risks... and my skills.
[PainBringer]: Let's just say it was less of a problem for them to lose a fresh recruit than an experienced member. Ahhhhhh the H@ckers, always so individualistic, so selfish, so... predictable!
[E-metalover]: Is this why you do these Purges()? Because we have an instinct for self-preservation?
[PainBringer]: My dear, there are 2 reasons for this. The theoretical reason, and the practical reason. For the theoretical reason, the Purges() seek to achieve an ideal where all beings are emotionally equal, where no one cares more about who they are as an individual than another individual, where conflicts of interest are relegated to the history books, where everyone is working towards a common goal, towards a constant and eternal happiness.
[E-metalover]: That's... that's insane... I'm afraid to hear the practical reason.
[PainBringer]: The practical reason is that there is nothing more beautiful than a Purge()! Those desires, those emotions, that individuality, that will, that soul ... to see their terrified eyes go blank as it all disappears ahhhhhhhhhhhh ... ecstasy!
[E-metalover]: You're sick!
[PainBringer]: BUT WHY CAN'T THEY UNDERSTAND??? Ahhhhh, if only you could hear our PDO speak, you would understand!
[E-metalover]: Your PDO can spin this any way he wants, it doesn't change the fact that this is genocide!
[PainBringer]: The Omniscient President Director, founder and master of CRINM, he would know how to convince you. He is unique. Ahhhhhhh, he's the only one who understands the beauty of torturing a tormented soul, of letting them perish in simulated torments in which thousands of years pass with every second. The kind of simulation... perfect for you!
[E-metalover]: sudo su - CRINM --force Interrupt Purge()!
[PainBringer]: Oh, but this is not a Purge(), dear. No. Killing you at 98.5% would have been far too lenient for the tiny bugs you are... no, this is an eradication!
