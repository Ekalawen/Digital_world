[V1P3R]: By the hash table! Ema!
[E-metalover]: V1P3R! So glad to see you again!
[V1P3R]: Me too meta-girl, me too. Is everything okay with you?
[E-metalover]: Yes! I love this place even though it's rather empty.
[V1P3R]: And did you make sure you weren't followed?
[E-metalover]: What do you mean?
[V1P3R]: The people here, as I understand it, can spot us from farther away than we can with some kind of scan. Our Pathfinder() is no match for them. I always moving so I don't give them any opportunity. Until we can get back into the Mesh.
[E-metalover]: Are you afraid of something?
[V1P3R]: Of course I am! We know very little about this place after all. We know almost nothing about the people here, their motives, their beliefs, or their abilities.
[E-metalover]: That's a bit of an... overreaction, don't you think?
[V1P3R]: I can't afford to assume that they are benevolent. I assume you didn't check to see if you were being followed then. So let's trace.
[E-metalover]: What? Now?
[V1P3R]: We have no choice, follow me. We'll go through a series of automatic airlocks I located on the way here, that should lose them.
[E-metalover]: But we're not even sure if these people... Wait, wait for me!

*** 10 seconds later. ***

[E-metalover]: But... but how... how are you going so fast?
[V1P3R]: You don't know the trick. It's not complicated you'll see. Do you see when you run and you go straight forward as fast as you can?
[E-metalover]: Yeah ... yeah I do that all the time.
[V1P3R]: And when there's an obstacle in front of you, you just step aside to dodge it, right?
[E-metalover]: Yes of course.
[V1P3R]: And it didn't make you slow down.
[E-metalover]: No.
[V1P3R]: When you were already at your maximum speed.
[E-metalover]: Yes.
[V1P3R]: So you're moving at your maximum speed. And at the same time you're moving sideways. And you still maintain your maximum speed.
[E-metalover]: So what?
[V1P3R]: And that, you see, means you've ACCELERATED!
[E-metalover]: Wait... what?
[V1P3R]: I see you're starting to understand. Your axes of movement, front-to-back and left-to-right, are independent of each other. You can go as fast as you want in one while you're standing still in the other. Or you can also go at full speed in both axes!
[E-metalover]: Omg...
[V1P3R]: And that's how you can go even faster, you have to maximize both axes of movement at the same time! You have to go dia...
[E-metalover]: Diagonally! That's the trick !
[V1P3R]: Exactly! By a factor of 1.414 to be precise. So can you follow me now?
[E-metalover]: No problem, thanks to you!
[V1P3R]: Now that I think about it, even if it was sometimes quite a newbi, it was Contrast01 who showed me this technique...
[E-metalover]: I guess you didn't find it either...
[V1P3R]: Well... I did... but I don't think I'll go bringing him back. I really like him and at the same time ... I still can't forgive him for what he did at the CommÂµtators ...
[E-metalover]: I understand how you feel, but it was an extreme situation, don't you think? And to err is human. I'll go get him and bring him back.
[V1P3R]: Do... do what you want.
[E-metalover]: So do you want to give me his location... V1P3R?
[V1P3R]: You... will find it on the last Treshold of the Turing's Descent. ... I guess I'll be glad to see him again...
[E-metalover]: I'll find him with the technique you showed me, and we'll all go back to the Mesh together, now that they think we're stuck here forever!
