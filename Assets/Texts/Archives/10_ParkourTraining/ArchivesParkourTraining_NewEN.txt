[E-metalover]: Ha! That was easy.
[Morgensoul*]: I wouldn't say that if I were you. You triggered a Jump(). But I suspected that would happen.
[E-metalover]: Just one.
[Morgensoul*]: One is enough. Like I said, they're directly connected to the Indexing Reactor.
[E-metalover]: Shit, so we've been spotted?
[Morgensoul*]: No, the Reactor automatically updates itself every week. The next update is scheduled for the day after tomorrow. This will give us the time to move to another Matrix so we don't get located. We weren't taking too many risks anyway.
[E-metalover]: I have the feeling that you still don't trust me completely.
[Morgensoul*]: Personally, I never trust anyone completely. And I never will. That's ridiculously naive.

[V1P3R]: The CRINM just launched a Purge() on our location!
[Morgensoul*]: Already!? I thought we had at least 2 days of downtime on this side? Where did you get the info from?
[V1P3R]: It's from Wolfv√òre. The info is safe, we have very little time. This Matrix was a bidirectional relay from the Empathy Archipelago, that's why they've got us gridded so quickly. Is the meta-girl ready?
[Morgensoul*]: We're done now, but I haven't had the time to explain to her how...
[E-metalover]: ... It's well orchestrated, but I'm not buying into your fake-simulation this time!
[Morgensoul*]: We've only gone down two levels in the simulation! If you already can't distinguish reality ... Oh, come on! You don't believe us? Why don't you stay and see for yourself!
[V1P3R]: Meta-girl, whether it's a test or the real simulation, what difference does it make? Either way, you'll behave the same. 
[E-metalover]: It changes that... I...
[V1P3R]: We must act quickly, now. Morg, you're coming with me. We'll try to disrupt and delay them. Then I'll go get Contrast01.
[Morgensoul*]: Damn it! The Silencer you go back to the Matrix core to save as much Data as possible. Watch out for the few remaining Jumps() that might be left.
[E-metalover]: You're sending me into the lion's den here, aren't you?
[Morgensoul*]: You wanted to join the H@ckers? It's time to prove to yourself that you really can do it!
[E-metalover]: I... I can!
[V1P3R]: Perfect, you shouldn't have more than 15 seconds once you're in. Be concise.
[E-metalover]: Wait what?? 15s??
[Morgensoul*]: Here we go!
