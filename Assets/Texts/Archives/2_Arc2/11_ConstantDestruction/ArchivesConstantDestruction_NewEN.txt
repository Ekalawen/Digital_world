[E-metalover]: Contrast?? What the hell are you still doing here? Didn't you get the alert?
[Contrast01]: I did get it, but it wasn't a priority at the time...

<color=#RED>*** Reality Engin<b></b>e unstable. ***
*** Please evacuate the Matri<b></b>x as soon as possible. ***</color>

[E-metalover]: The Matrix's Reality Engine will eventually collapse, what could be more of a priority than that? We need to get out of here!
[Contrast01]: If I could have gotten out, believe me, I would have!
[E-metalover]: You don't understand, it's no coincidence that the CRINM is attacking us at the same time, the Matrix is going to collapse, and us with it!
[Contrast01]: Yes, I do understand. The problem is that it's already too late. All the exit hyper-links have already been calibrated to loop-infinity mode, so there's no way out.
[E-metalover]: And you stayed here knowing that this would happen?
[Contrast01]: I had to finish this hack, no matter what it cost me, I was only a few megabytes away from finishing the download...

<color=#RED>*** Collapse of the Matri<b></b>x imminent. ***</color>

[Contrast01]: But at least now I know. I knew it in my heart, and now I'm sure. I made the right choice.
[E-metalover]: Look, it's not over, if all the exit hyper-links are dead and we're stuck here, then we'll stop the collapse!
[Contrast01]: And we're going to wait here until the CRINM Purgators come and pick us up? It's over, Ema.
[E-metalover]: No, until the hyper-links are reactivated from the outside. V1P3R sent me!
[Contrast01]: But... damn... that could work!
[E-metalover]: Of course it'll work! But for that to happen, we need to access the Matrix core to stabilize it. You're going to help me, you're going to guide me to each of the rifts, one by one!
[Contrast01]: Okay! Give me a second to run the first scans...
[E-metalover]: We'll make sure you didn't download those data in vain! What was it about by the way?
[Contrast01]: My father's disappearance. And how I'm going to blow up those CRINMinals!

<color=#RED>*** Collapse of the Matri<b></b>x in 3, 2... ***</color>
