[V1P3R]: Are you two okay and in one piece?
[Contrast01]: That was really close, I don't know how to thank you!
[E-metalover]: Don't worry, I think you'll have more than one opportunity to repay your debt...
[V1P3R]: Clearly. The CRINM is everywhere, we can't escape them forever, it's only a matter of time before they find us.
[E-metalover]: We need to get out of this area!
[V1P3R]: To be honest, now that they've started the process, I'm not even sure if there's really a safe place in the whole Mesh anymore...
[Contrast01]: It's okay, we'll just keep changing locations every week before the Indexing Reactor is updated and then we'll ...
[E-metalover]: No, V1P3R is right, it won't be enough. We're registered now. And you're not Silencers.
[V1P3R]: The best thing would be to join the Parallel Web, where the CRINM has no control, no power.
[E-metalover]: Wait, the Parallel Web... you mean that second simulation, the one that was created as a dark copy of the Mesh shortly after the Mental Blackout?
[V1P3R]: Yes, that's right.
[E-metalover]: But, I thought it was just a legend!
[V1P3R]: History is written by the winners. And that's what they wanted us to believe. It was our founder, WolfvØre, who created this world. They could not tolerate this act of rebellion, but they could not destroy it either, so they hid it. It is real, however...
[Contrast01]: However, all its access points, which are called Commµtators, have all been deactivated. You can imagine by whom.
[WolfvØre]: No. Not all of them.

[V1P3R]: Boss!
[Contrast01]: Boss!
[WolfvØre]: They can't resign themselves to give up control of half the world. They'll never shut down all the Commµtators. I've located a handful in the Matrix #994299777, near the CRIN<b></b>M_EXTERNAL. I will scan the area. Use the waves to locate the Commµtators. But keep a low profile, or they will reinforce their defense!
