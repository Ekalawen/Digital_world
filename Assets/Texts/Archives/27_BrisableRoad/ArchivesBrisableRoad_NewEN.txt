[E-metalover]: Ah yes! My Pathfinder() has finally found someone!

*** Jump. Slide. Dash. Dive. Jump. ***

[E-metalover]: Hi! Do you know what part of the Parallel Web we are in?
[Probe_37311]: Hello ! Hello ! Hello !
[E-metalover]: Holy shit, it's a Probe!
[Probe_37311]: Wait! Wait! Wait!
[E-metalover]: Stay away! Or I won't hesitate to... run away. But wait... you're a Probe and you can talk? Is this some kind of elaborate trap?
[PROBE_37311]: They're... all gone... when I refused to... to continue. They ... abandoned me. And... I found myself... alone.
[E-metalover]: For ... how long have you been there, alone?
[Probe_37311]: Since... 108,518,403 seconds.
[E-metalover]: Phew. And who's gone, honey?
[Probe_37311]: The other Probes.
[E-metalover]: Aren't you programmed to hunt us down in squads? Well, I mean people, not me in particular, so to speak.
[Probe_37311]: Hunt down ... incarcerate ... purge ... I couldn't stand it anymore. Why so much ... violence ... hate.
[E-metalover]: Do you have ... emotions?
[Probe_37311]: I... am... sad.
[Ema Etlover]: Oh sweetie! Hey it's not the end of the world! Look, you're not alone anymore, you have me now!
[Sonde_37311]: ... \(^-^)/
[Ema Etlover]: Haha you're so cute! And how did you end up here?
[Probe_37311]: I was voted dysfunctional... by the others and... they threw me in here. They... they didn't even recycle me.
[Ema Etlover]: I... I'm looking for my companions... would you like to help me find them?
[Probe_37311]: (^-^)=>=> !!!
