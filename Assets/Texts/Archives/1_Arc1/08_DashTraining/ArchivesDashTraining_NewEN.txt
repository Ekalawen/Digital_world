[Morgensoul*]: Human or AI, we both know that a Netrunner isn't worth much without its programs.
[Ema Etlover]: We agree! I've heard that the most experienced ones can use up to 4 in multithreading!
[Morgensoul*]: Yeah well, we're not there yet. If you join the H@ckers, you'll have to know how to use the program we have developed.
[Ema Etlover]: Oh this is interesting!
[Morgensoul*]: It's a software we've been developing for a few months now. We know it has a lot of potential, but our hardware isn't powerful enough to fully support it yet.
[Ema Etlover]: And what exactly does it allow you to do?
[Morgensoul*]: We call it Dash75! It will allow you to perform your hacks even faster!
[Ema Etlover]: Cool! And you're giving it to me like this?
[Morgensoul*]: Give it up? It doesn't cost us anything, it's just a copy.
[Ema Etlover]: That's the power of computers, duplicating knowledge costs nothing!
[Morgensoul*]: Well, it costs time, memory and attention. But isn't it one of the reasons to live? Anyway, don't forget that this is an intensive test, we put all the power of our decentralized hardware to power this simulation. On the battlefield Dash75 is much less efficient...
