[Ema Etlover]: What the hell was that? That was not the CRINM!
[Morgensoul*]: At least you realized it. But it's alarming that you didn't realize it sooner. We don't send a new recruit to risk everything on the world's number one multinational company...
[Ema Etlover]: Do you fool all of us in the same way?
[Morgensoul*]: Every assimilation is unique. For you especially ...
[Ema Etlover]: Do I get a special treatment now?
[Morgensoul*]: It's not every day that the H@ckers meet a Silencer. I searched the Indexing Reactor. I requested the Sea of Consciousness. No traces, no logs, no reference, nothing, nada! It's like your profile never existed...
[Ema Etlover]: You know I'm asking myself the same question, that's why I'm here. To find out. To find out why, for them, I don't exist.
[Morgensoul*]: What amazes me the most is that it's still going on. I should already be able to find traces of the hack you just did. And yet ... nothing.

[Ema Etlover]: The next?!
[Morgensoul*]: Yes. A Matrix is most often protected. Let's see how good you are against a Probe.
[Ema Etlover]: A Probe? I'm familiar with that kind of defense, and I can even use it to my advantage!
