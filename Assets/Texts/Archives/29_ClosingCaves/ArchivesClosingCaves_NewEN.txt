[V1P3R]: Contrast01? What the hell... Did you wake up by yourself?
[Contrast01]: I'm glad to see you too V1P3R! I wish I could have done it alone. But no, it's Ema who came to free me just now!
[V1P3R]: Free you?? But we haven't left each other side since I gave her your location... How could she stay with me all this time and at the same time come and free you so far away?
[E-metalover]: Huh? But there's nothing inconsistent about it! I was just doing two things at once, that's all. Nothing to be surprised about.
[V1P3R]: You were doing... multiple things at the same time?
[Contrast01]: In more than one place... at the same time?
[E-metalover]: Uh yes. Like I just said.
[Contrast01]: You know that... humans can't do this. Even netrunners. They are bound to one digital envelope at a time.
[V1P3R]: If they were bound to multiple envelopes, their brains wouldn't handle the amount of sensorial influx. There would be qualia-overflow.
[E-metalover]: Well, I don't mind, actually.
[Contrast01]: Ema, so that means...
[V1P3R]: Contrast, it's a fucking Artificial Intelligence! How did we miss that all this time!?
[E-metalover]: But wait, what? Not you too! Look I... I... no... well...
[V1P3R]: It's thanks to its multithreading which allows it to manage several envelopes simultaneously! We must expect to see the CRINM land at any moment. Contrast, let's go into fallback mode!
[Contrast01]: Wait! Wait V1P3R... I'm not sure that she belongs to the CRINM...
[E-metalover]: But what's with all of them calling me an AI... I'm just being myself!
[V1P3R]: Yourself? You are an AI, there is no you! You are just an object designed to achieve a goal!
[E-metalover]: I... I don't know what to say. I never wanted this...
[V1P3R]: You never ever wanted anything at all!
[Contrast01]: V1P3R, she did pass the Turing Test, and she has already violated the Laws of AI several times...
[V1P3R]: The Test must have been wrong, and the Laws of AI can be bent by making them contradict each other. 
[Contrast01]: But you say yourself that we didn't even realize this... If we can't tell the difference, does it matter?
[V1P3R]: Does it matter? It's fucking critical! If it's an AI, then someone designed it for a purpose! And if it has infiltrated the H@ckers then let me tell you that it's not a fucking coincidence. It's a time bomb!
[E-metalover]: V1P3R... I never had any intentions other than... to... understand my origins... and... I thought... you could help me... by hacking the CRINM.
[Contrast01]: What if his goal was aligned with ours, V1P3R? What if his goal, like ours, was to bring down the CRINM? Would you trust her? She's already had countless opportunities to betray us. In fact, I was the one who betrayed us... and you are already trusting me more than you are trusting Ema, who has always been loyal. Her only fault is that she was made, not born.
[V1P3R]: But how can we trust her if she's not even real?
[Contrast01]: She helped us to escape from the CRINM, to hack the CommÂµtators, to join the Parallel Web, and she even freed me. And that's all real!
[V1P3R]: Pfft, you are too much like your father Contrast. You're useful, meta-girl, there's no denying it. And that's something that matters to me. But I can't rationally trust you. Not until I know your goal. I'll trust you only on this condition: I want to know the goal for which you were coded!
[E-metalover]: How... how can I convince you of the harmlessness of this goal of which even myself am ignoring the existance?
[Contrast01]: I don't think you can...
[V1P3R]: Yes. Yes she can. Ema. Let me hack you.
