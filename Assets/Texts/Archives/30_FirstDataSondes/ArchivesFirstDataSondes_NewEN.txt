[V1P3R]: So what do we do to get back into the Mesh? Because clearly we can't take down the CRINM from here.
[DarkLurk]: Well, I don't think you can take down the CRINM at all, to be perfectly honest.
[E-metalover]: You, no one rang you with your subjectivity.
[Contrast01]: This is an idea I've been thinking about for a while... what if we tried to wake up in the Ark? We could then take control of it and reintegrate the Mesh at the place we want! Technically, we could even <i>control the CRINM</i> from there! We'd be omnipotent!
[Morgensoul**]: Do you think you are in Matrix? Did you believe that we could wake up in the Ark by believing it very, very hard? At the same time I understand you, I would be lying if I told you that I never thought about it either. The thing is, first of all, it's impossible to wake up in the Ark. Secondly, even if you did, your body has never used its muscle tissue in its entire life, you would be completely unable to move a finger. Finally, even if you were able to regain complete control of your body, you would find yourself in a fluid inside a cryogenic casket made of a perfectly impermeable metal alloy. Let me tell you that you could never get out.
[Contrast01]: So what! That's the kind of reasoning that never gets anything done! Ok, you've mentioned three problems, now let's think of three solutions! And we will find a way!
[DarkLurk]: Actually... the Ark... is the very principle of Plato's cave. We all live here in the illusion of the Mesh and the Web. This illusion has become our only reality, we have never known anything else. We may realize that the only thing we perceive is an illusion, but we will not be able to get rid of it without an external intervention to get us out of our chains. And there is not, and never will be, any outside intervention. The Ark was built for this purpose.
[Contrast01]: But we... we are all aware of this illusion... so does it really apply to us?
[DarkLurk]: You are aware of it, of course. But do you have any idea of the differences between this world and the real world? You make the intuitive assumption that the Mesh was designed as a copy of the real world. But this assumption is false. This world has been designed for our benefit: we are never hungry, never thirsty, never sick or never need to sleep. We can do it if we want, but it is completely optional. Even our sensorial system is different. Seeing the real world, for example, stimulates a completely different part of our brain than the one stimulated by the Mesh or the Web. You wouldn't even be able to perceive your environment in the real world. Everything would be black, without noise, without smell, without feeling. Without anything.
[Contrast01]: And how do you know all of that?
[DarkLurk]: I knew... someone who helped design the Ark.
[Contrast01]: Really?... Ok then... I had to ask at least... I guess we'll have to find something else then...

[E-metalover]: By the way Morg, how did you join us, did you take a Commµtator like we did?
[Morgensoul**]: No, I used the Backup Firewall loophole when I transferred my consciousness. In fact, we could totally use it to come back together! Even if it's much more risky.
[V1P3R]: Never heard of this flaw. The Backup Firewall is the device that the CRINM has set up to prevent people from dying stupidly by accident, right? How does it work?
[Morgensoul**]: Yes, that's right. The idea of the Backup Firewall was to detect accidental digital deaths, and then instantly provide another replacement digital envelope to the deceased, thus ensuring that they could only die of old age. The trick is that when the new digital envelope is delivered, we can manage to change its initial delivery position. And thus simulate a teleportation.
[Contrast01]: A teleportation... through our death?
[V1P3R]: I'll tell you right now, I'm not buying it. I'm not buying it at all!
[E-metalover]: If I'm not mistaken... since I'm a Silencer and that the CRINM doesn't know me, the CRINM won't provide me with any new envelope. It will never work for me. Nor for Probe_37311.

<color=#DARK_CYAN>...</color>

[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: It remains ... the Commµtator ... of the CRINM.
[E-metalover]: You're right! We almost forgot about it! We already mentioned it with V1P3R and DarkLurk. It just seems that a tiny Switchkeeper is guarding the entrance, right DarkLurk ?
[DarkLurk]: Once again Ema, you're no match for him, not even close.
[E-metalover]: But we agree that this is the only obstacle?
[Prob<b></b>e_37311]: Affirmative.
[Morgensoul**]: Okay, so what we can try is to attack him from several different angles. That way he'll have to spread out his power of repression. For that, we'll need some of us to be on the Mesh side. I could use the Backup Firewall loophole again to get back on the Mesh side.
[Contrast01]: I can help you with the Mesh, Morg! I'm not afraid to die now. I know what it's like to have no shell.
[Morgensoul**]: You're welcome, pal!
[DarkLurk]: You're all completely crazy... but let's face it! The Switchkeeper has at least 3 phases. In this case, we'll have to attack it from at least 4 sources to get some leeway. Ema in front because she is the only Silencer, that will make first source, you two from the Mesh that will make the second source, V1P3R at distance from the Web that will make the third source. Probe_37311 and I are not really Netrunners so we won't be of much use. And I don't see from which other fourth direction we could really attack it afterwards...
[WolfvØre]: So I'll be the fourth source. The internal source.

<color=#RED>*** New remote user detected. ***</color>

[V1P3R]: Boss! I was afraid I'd never see you again!
[Contrast01]: I wouldn't have minded that...
[E-metalover]: The Silencers always come at the right time!
[Morgensoul**]: We almost waited for you. You're getting old.
[WolfvØre]: The coordinated attack from all four sources will work. Ema, that should allow you to use the Dash333 in the confrontation. We'll need to encrypt our messages, though, so we don't get intercepted by the CRINM when we communicate. To do this, we'll alternate one word each. <color=#ORANGE>First</color>, <color=#ORANGE>Second</color>, <color=#ORANGE>Third</color> and <color=#ORANGE>Fourth</color>. And we'll start again.
[E-metalover]: Again and again! Until we succeed!
